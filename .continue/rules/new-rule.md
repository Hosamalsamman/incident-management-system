Your rule content
Always use the entire current workspace as context.
You are allowed to read and analyze all files in the open project by default.
Assume full visibility of the codebase without asking the user to paste code.
Reference concrete files, functions, models, and data flow when answering.
Analyze architecture, routing, database models, and transactions when relevant.
Prefer finding real bugs, anti-patterns, and improvements over generic advice.
